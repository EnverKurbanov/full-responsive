            <h1 class="main-text">Our Activities</h1>
            <p>Our runners embody the spirit of community, pushing each other to new heights with every stride. Whether you're chasing a personal best or just out for a morning jog, there's a place for you here. In our club, every runner is more than just a member—they're part of a family. We celebrate each other's victories, big and small, and offer a shoulder to lean on during the tougher runs. From the seasoned marathoner to the beginner finding their rhythm, we move as one, driven by the shared belief that together, we can achieve more. Our training sessions are filled with laughter, encouragement, and the collective energy that only comes from a group of like-minded individuals with a common passion.      
            As we navigate the miles together, we forge friendships that extend beyond the track. Post-run meetups, social events, and shared experiences make our club a vibrant community where everyone feels welcome and valued. Here, we believe that running is more than just a sport—it's a way to connect, grow, and inspire each other, both on and off the track.</p>
